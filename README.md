Learning Linear Regression with Python
Overview
This project aims to help a real estate agent predict house prices in various regions of the United States using linear regression. By leveraging a dataset of 5,000 houses from different areas, we will create a model that allows the agent to input certain features of a house and receive an estimated price.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is titled "Maisons.csv" and contains the following features:

Revenu_moyen: The average income of residents in the city where the house is located.
Age_moyen: The average age of houses in the city.
Nb_moyen_pieces: The average number of rooms in houses in the city.
Nb_moyen_chambres: The average number of bedrooms in houses in the city.
Population: The population of the city.
Prix: The actual price the house was sold for.
Adresse: The address of the house.
Objective
The goal is to apply the supervised learning technique of linear regression to predict the price of a new house based on its characteristics.
